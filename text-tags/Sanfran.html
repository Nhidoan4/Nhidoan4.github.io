            San Francisco: the best in the worst.
        </h1>
        
        <h2> 
            The best neighborhood is Alamo Square. 
        </h2>
        
         <p>
             I like Alamo Square because of the nice <strong>Victorian houses</strong> there, which known as <em>"the painted ladies."</em> 
             The architecture of these Victorian Houses also attracts many tourists.

        <h2> 
            The worst neighborhood is Ingleside.
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            I don't like Ingleside because it's <strong>always cold</strong> there!
