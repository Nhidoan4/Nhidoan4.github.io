        I also had fun while working on this project! 

I created my own characters in Illustrator and made it move in Animate! I had some struggles with finding the right sounds, but I worked it out finally. My animation about a lazy guy uses his wife's eyelash curler to open his coke because he is too lazy to find the coke opener.
